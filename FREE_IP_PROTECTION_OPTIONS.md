## 6. üè† Home Network Protection (Best Free Option)

**What We've Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting (15/hour max)
- ‚úÖ Human-like delays
- ‚úÖ Header randomization
- ‚úÖ User-Agent rotation
- ‚úÖ Request fingerprint variance
- ‚úÖ Error monitoring

**Additional Steps You Can Take:**

```bash
# Restart router to get new IP (works with some ISPs)
# Do this every few hours if scraping regularly
```

### B. Use Different Devices
- Laptop for personal use
- Old phone/tablet for scraping
- Separate devices = different fingerprints

### C. Browser Isolation
- Use separate Chrome profile
- Clear cookies between sessions

## üéØ Recommended Strategy (FREE)

**For Personal/Small Scale:**

1. **Software Protection** (Already implemented ‚úÖ)
   - Rate limiting
   - Header randomization
   - Human-like behavior

2. **Manual IP Rotation** (Your ISP):
   - Restart router every 2-3 hours
   - Most ISPs give new IP on restart
   - Check: whatismyipaddress.com

3. **Device Isolation**:
   - Dedicated device for scraping
   - Clear browser data regularly
   - Use different browser than personal use

4. **Conservative Usage**:
   - Max 10-15 products/hour (already set)
   - Spread usage across day
   - Don't scrape daily - take breaks

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Watch error logs
   - If you see 429/503, stop immediately
   - Wait 24 hours before resuming
